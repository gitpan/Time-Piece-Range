NAME
    Time::Piece::Range - deal with a range of Time::Piece objects

SYNOPSIS
            use Time::Piece::Range;

            my $range = Time::Piece::Range->new($t1, $d2);

            my $earliest = $range->start;
            my $latest = $range->end;
            my $days = $range->length;

            if ($range->includes($d3)) { ... }
            if ($range->includes($range2)) { ... }

            if ($range->overlaps($range2)) {
                    my $range3 = $range->overlap($range2);
            }

            foreach my $date ($range->dates) { ... }

            my $range3 = $range->gap($range2);

            if ($range->abuts($range2)) { ... }

DESCRIPTION
    This is a subclass of Date::Range that uses Time::Piece objects rather
    than Date::Simple objects.

    It only works at the precision of complete days - times are ignored in
    all calculations.
